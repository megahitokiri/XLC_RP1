# Cranefoot3 configuration file.
# Ville-Petteri Makinen 2006

# General notes:
# - To draw a pedigree, you must provide at least a PedigreeFile,
#   PedigreeName, NameVariable, FatherVariable and MotherVariable.
# - Use ASCII text files for input, with an Excel sheet like heading row.
# - Variables are detected based on their headings.
# - By default, data is read from the pedigree file, but you can give other
#   input files as well for most of the variables.
# - Output format is PostScript graphics, use image processing software
#   (e.g. Gimp, ImageMagick) to convert to other formats.

# Use these two instructions to specify the primary input file and naming
# of the output files. Suppose you set PedigreeName to 'myPedigree', then
# the main document will be named 'myPedigree.ps' and the image files
# 'myPedigree_<family_name>.eps', where family names are those given in the
# input file. In addition, the topology and node coordinates will be saved
# in 'myPedigree.topology.eps'.
PedigreeFile       Retinitis_Pedigree.txt
PedigreeName       Retinitis_XLC

# These are the topologically relevant variables. Name, father and mother
# should be available in the primary file (i.e. PedigreeFile), but the
# others can be given in separate files if necessary. In this case, gender
# and sibling order (e.g. age) is in a separate file and, to avoid unnecessary
# work, it is not necessary that these secondary input files are sorted or
# that they contain a row for every individual. You must, however, make sure
# that every file contains a name column, in this case with the heading
# 'NAME' because without it the additional information cannot be assigned to
# correct individuals.

# It is often necessary to list the meanings of symbols so that every reader
# can understand the pedigree picture. CraneFoot create a legend for every
# family automatically, based on the common instructions. These info commands
# do not affect the pedigree itself in any way, except taking a small
# portion of the page. The first value (e.g. 'low') is a short description of
# the symbol, and the second (e.g. 999900) indicates the symbol itself.

# Unlike the previous versions of CraneFoot, the third generation employs an
# undeterministic optimization algorithm the spreads the family graph around
# the canvas. For this reason, the user can set a time limit to ensure that
# the program completes in reasonable time. It is also possible to set a
# fixed seed for the random number generator to ensure repeatable layouts.

# Miscellaneous commands. The first value for PaperSize sets the main
# document dimensions, the second sets a fixed paper size for the .eps files.
# The optimal bounding box for an .eps file is rarely a standard paper size
# and thus might cause problems when converting to other formats.
